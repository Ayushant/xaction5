## Future Quiz Components

### Guidelines for Creating New Quiz Components
When creating new quiz/simulation components in the future:

1. **DO NOT** implement a Previous button or `handlePrevious()` function
2. **ONLY** allow forward navigation through questions
3. **Use** one of these existing patterns:
   - `DecisionChallenge.jsx` - For decision-based challenges
   - `RankingQuiz.jsx` - For ranking/priority quizzes
   - `StudentQuiz.jsx` - For standard MCQ quizzes

4. **Navigation Buttons Should Be:**
   ```jsx
   // Only forward navigation - centered layout
   <div className="flex items-center gap-4 justify-center">
     <button onClick={handleNext}>
       {isLastQuestion ? "Submit Final" : "Next Question"}
     </button>
   </div>
   ```

5. **DO NOT** implement:
   ```jsx
   // ❌ DON'T DO THIS
   {currentQuestionIndex > 0 && (
     <button onClick={handlePrevious}>Previous</button>
   )}
   ```
